Building information models (BIM) in IFC capture rich semantic and geometric representations of facilities. However, querying and reasoning over IFC with conventional file-centric tools remains cumbersome. Graph databases such as Neo4j offer a natural substrate for expressing entities and relationships across spatial, functional, and system perspectives.

This work introduces an end-to-end approach---implemented in this repository---for turning IFC models into a property graph suitable for analysis and retrieval. Our contributions are:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item A reproducible pipeline for converting IFC to a compact JSON representation and ingesting it into Neo4j as typed nodes and relationships.
  \item Spatial linking methods to infer adjacency, containment, and vertical relations from placements and elevations.
  \item Practical tools for identifier quality checks, schema definition, and probing spatial placements.
  \item A retrieval-augmented (RAG) layer to index graph-derived evidence for question answering.
\end{itemize}

We demonstrate the approach on sample hospital models, discuss limitations and data issues encountered (e.g., GUID overlap and inconsistent placements), and outline directions for scalable graph-based BIM analytics.
