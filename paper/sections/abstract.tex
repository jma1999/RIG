This paper presents a practical pipeline that converts Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) building information models into a Neo4j property graph and layers retrieval-augmented capabilities on top. We describe a modular ingestion framework that: (i) serializes IFC to compact JSON, (ii) constructs typed nodes and relationships in Neo4j aligned with a domain schema, and (iii) enriches connectivity by inferring spatial adjacency and vertical relationships. We report on experiments using sample architectural and mechanical hospital models, analyze identifier consistency and spatial placement quality, and outline a research agenda for graph-based BIM reasoning and question answering.
