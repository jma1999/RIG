We presented a practical, modular pipeline that transforms IFC models into a Neo4j property graph and layers retrieval capabilities for question answering. The approach emphasizes clear schema, spatial enrichment, and utilities for identifier and placement diagnostics. Early results on hospital models suggest that graph-based BIM is a promising foundation for analytics and grounded QA. Next steps include expanding model coverage, hardening spatial inference, and releasing standardized benchmarks.
